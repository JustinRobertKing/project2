## Challenges In Development

#### Sifting through the APIs

While not necessarily difficult, one of the more time consuming tasks for this project was to sift through all of the API documentation provided by `brewerydb.com`. They have just about every spec of information that you could need for a brewery.. if you know where to look for it. Take the time to really get to know the structure of the information at your fingertips. This makes the development process flow much more naturally as you move forward. 

#### Mapbox is a bit of a nightmare

Want to know how to change a color? Here's an entire tutorial on how to build a map from scratch, add points, add zoom controls, and locate the user! But... how do I change a color? Oh, didn't you see the code for that nested in the forEach loop under the add points section of the tutorial? NO?? Come on, it's all right there!

I think you get the idea. There is almost no such thing as a reference doc. There are, however, piles and piles of tutorials that may have what you need nested somewhere inside of it. Also, you can't make a marker a link without nesting it in a popup. That is not intuitive.
